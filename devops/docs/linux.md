* System diagnostics: Devices, CPU, memory, IO, networking
* Logs
* Processes
* Inspecting filesystem and open files
* Sockets and networking 
*


## System Diagonostics
* top
* mpstat
* sar # install using apt-get install sysstat
    Cron job present here `cat /etc/cron.d/sysstat`
    sar between 10AM-12 AM `sar -r -s 10:00:00 -e 12:00:00`
    sar on 10th of the month `sar -f /var/log/sysstat/sa10 -b`

## Logs
There are various log files generated in Linux system which will help debugging the errors.

### journalctl 
journalctl is a command for viewing logs collected by systemd. The systemd-journald service is responsible for systemdâ€™s log collection, and it retrieves messages from the kernel, systemd services, and other sources.

`journalctl -r`
`journalctl -u telegraf --no-pager -f` to see all the logs without paging and following the running logs

persist logs by making changes here /etc/systemd/journald.conf
