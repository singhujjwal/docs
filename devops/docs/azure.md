# AZURE 

## Account and Subscription
Your company has an account and you get access to the portal.azure.com but if you don't have
a subscription, you can't do anything.
In that case either you need to be assigned to a subscription or you should have an owner
role to create a subscription in that account. The account can be alternatively be called
as tenant.
Here is a [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) that describe all
types of roles in Azure

[This](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-definitions) defines a role is constructed using json, the similar way AWS IAM policies work.
